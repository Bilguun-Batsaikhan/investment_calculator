    <h1>How the Calculation Works</h1>

    <p>
      This investment calculator operates on an annual compounding basis, adding
      contributions at the end of each year. Here's a breakdown of the key
      calculations performed for each year:
    </p>

    <h2>Interest Earned in Year:</h2>
    <p>
      This is calculated by multiplying the <code>investmentValue</code> at the
      beginning of the year by the <code>expectedReturn</code> rate.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Interest Earned =</strong>
      <code>Current Investment Value × (Expected Return / 100)</code>
    </p>

    <h2>Investment Value at End of Year:</h2>
    <p>
      The <code>investmentValue</code> is updated by adding the
      <code>interestEarnedInYear</code> and the
      <code>annualInvestment</code> (your new contribution for that year). This
      new value becomes the starting point for the next year's calculation.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Value End of Year =</strong>
      <code
        >Starting Investment Value + Interest Earned + Annual Investment</code
      >
    </p>

    <h2>Total Amount Invested:</h2>
    <p>
      This simply tracks the cumulative amount of money you have personally
      contributed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Total Amount Invested =</strong>
      <code>Initial Investment + (Annual Investment × Current Year)</code>
    </p>

    <h2>Total Interest Earned:</h2>
    <p>
      This represents the total profit your investment has generated up to that
      point. It's the <code>valueEndOfYear</code> minus all the money you've put
      in.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Total Interest =</strong>
      <code>Value End of Year - Total Amount Invested</code>
    </p>
